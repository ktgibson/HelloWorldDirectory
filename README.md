# This is closed now!
I opened this up for the Hacktoberfest event and now that has ended.

# Hello, World!
A directory of "Hello, World" in your favorite, or least favorite, programming language!

### Why does this exist?!
Simple! I've just started to learn how to write code and very much want to learn git but I don't think I'm ready to contribute to opensource just yet! So I decided to create my own public repo and start researching different programming languages.

### Why hello world?
I decided what better way to kick off learning git with the one tutorial we all know and love!

### Can I contribute?
Of course! It will be really interesting to see what new programming languages everyone adds!
